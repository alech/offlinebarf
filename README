== Description
A quick hack to put pentabarf.cccv.org into a Git repository
and allow users to push back ratings to the 'barf.

== Installation
Create a YAML config file in ~/.offlinebarf.cfg with
username, password and repo keys (where repo is the path
to the Git repository).

== Usage
Run offlinebarf.rb to download the 'barf into the Git
repository. If you want to rate talks, create a file with
the name <eventid>_rating.txt with four lines. The first
line is a rating for acceptance (of the form '--', '-',
'o', '+' or '++'), the second line a rating for actuality,
the third line a rating for relevance and the fourth line
is the remark. Add those files and commit them to the
repository, then run offlinebarf.rb.
